# Code-Ware History
## What is Code-Ware
Code-Ware used to be a Roblox Internal Executor Script (Which we call RIES) Code-Ware used to have it's own API for it's executor, and a built-in script hub. Code-Ware used to be owned by Eagles which later got deleted.

## What is Eagles
Eagles is a Server that has tools which is owned by Typical Operator AKA Typx AKA Me. Eagles mainly focused on making Roblox Tools. Although using a cheat executor is against Roblox's ToS, Eagles was not giving people advantages but make it better performance, and more realistic, And other stuff aswell. Eagles later got discontinued due to Byfron which is also why Code-Ware for Roblox is no longer available.
